# My ML models written from scratch

Some of my models, wich I have written from scratch in Python are solving the same task.
Here they are:

- Soft Max Regression
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- GBM
- AdaBoost

They all solve the same classification problem. Results are plotted on the same graph for comparing.
